"3.28", "Interpretive said that there's   inside of the machine"], ["210.03", "3.26", "a thing called an evaluator and interpreter which  when given a"], ["213.29", "4.68", "sequence of instructions

what was going when that happened  and it"], ["234.43", "4.46", "made it much easier to actually do the debugging  which is really handy"], ["238.89", "2.63", "And then the third element  which you haven't really seen much of unless you"], ["241.52", "5.07", "program in other languages  is that Python makes it easy for you to not"], ["246.59", "1.34", "worry about certain details"], ["247.93",

parts"], ["373.75", "2.79", "How do I use pseudo code to describe what I'm doing"], ["376.54", "2.92", "And then once I've broken it into parts  that'll tell me  for example"], ["379.46", "2.84", "what are good abstractions  both in terms of the data and in"], ["382.3", "1.43", "terms of the code"], ["383.73", "5.07", "And that  in particular  then leads to an easier way to actually code"], ["388.8", "3.57", "Because having broken it up into parts  I can test each of those units"], ["392.37", "2.93", "and then the overall thing  before I worry about building the"], ["395.3", "1.81", "whole entire system"], ["397.11", "3.47", "And finally  would really stress that you want to first make sure you've got"], ["400.58", "1.17", "something that works"], ["401.75", "2.16", "So focus first on functionality"], ["403.91", "3.09", "Once you've got an overall system that works  then you can think about"], ["407", "1.49", "efficiency"], ["408.49", "2.9", "But take it one step at a

debugging  think about running an experiment to"], ["420.83", "1.7", "understand where your bug is"], ["422.53", "3.83", "We talked about this idea  for example  of binary search as a nice"], ["426.36", "3.43", "way to isolate where your bug might be"], ["429.79", "3.46", "And in particular  I would hope that when you do create a code that has a"], ["433.25", "1.58", "bug   and it will happen"], ["434.83", "4.97", "that you ask yourself why did the program do what it did rather than why"], ["439.8", "1.97", "didn't it do what I wanted it to"], ["441.77", "4.37", "Solving this problem will more quickly lead you to debugging and creating"], ["446.14", "1.85", "correct code"], ["447.99", "3.15", "But those were the tools you used to actually write code"], ["451.14", "2.65", "Now with that  what were the big modules that we saw in the course"], ["453.79", "3.18", "Well  one of them was the idea of estimating complexity"], ["456.97", "4.38", "Here what we saw was that different algorithms fall into different classes"], ["461.35", "1.01", "of complexity"], ["462.36", "2.24", "We had that idea of Big O notation"], ["464.6", "3.63", "And what you've now seen is a

different patterns of"], ["476.67", "2.51", "computation that belong to those classes"], ["479.18", "3.91", "So this is really handy  because when you get a new problem you are going to"], ["483.09",

nice and efficient"], ["509.04", "4.92", "Others  some graph search methods  are much more complex  but that also was"], ["513.96", "5.26", "because sometimes the problems are just inherently

topics"], ["525.85", "3.98", "which was the notion of trying to find approximations"], ["529.83", "3.23", "But once we started realizing algorithms come in different classes"], ["533.06", "3.16", "and there are standard templates for them  it allowed us to start thinking"], ["536.22", "5.08", "about how to begin to map problems into particular solutions"], ["541.3", "2.13", "And that was  in fact
