it go to be a negat version of whatev the cube root of that absolut valu would be So we could actual go back and fix this and we can do it pretti straightforward Let go back into our code and in particular now just add a coupl thing One is we go to look to see whether the thing we check for is le than the absolut valu of x And similar to check to see whether the thing cube is equal to the absolut valu of x That nice And that straightforward All we have to do is when we done come down here and say onc we
