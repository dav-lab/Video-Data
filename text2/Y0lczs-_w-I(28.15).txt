In particular we go to introduc the concept of iter or how to repeat a method multipl time in order to reus the comput to execut someth an arbitrari number of time Once we have iter we can start do some interest class of algorithm Start with guess and check method the guess and answer check it and then use the result to improv the guess This will lead natur to the idea of loop construct or mechan in our languag that let u general the idea of repeat a comput until a particular condit is reach This will let u general our guess and check method to a broader group of algorithm call success approxim and especi to a veri common and veri power method call bisect search
