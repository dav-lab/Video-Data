item weight Final we have our usual test function We have testGreedi whose job it is simpli to run the greedi algorithm onc use the specifi metric and to print out the total number of item and their valu in the knapsack that get built use that particular metric And then final testGreedi allow u to test all three of the metric So let save that out and then give it to run and see what we get And here we go There the item we want to choos from right at the top So if we look here we see that if we use the valu metric the total valu of the item in the bag is and sort of what we expect becaus the most valuabl item is the comput which is the onli thing in the
