more reason run time Let get start Some optim problem exhibit properti which if they were true allow u to come up with a much more comput effici way to solv the problem The first properti is call optim substructur So suppos we have some optim problem express a the function f where we pas in an argument that ha some structur For exampl the argument may be a list of item and the shade area might repres the first half of the list and the unshad area the second half of the list In some problem we might discov that to come up with the optim solut for the origin problem we discov ourselv comput the
