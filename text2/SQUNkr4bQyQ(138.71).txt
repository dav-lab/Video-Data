I want to choos the paramet of my predict So in this case it would be the constant over k That the slope of the line I want to choos the slope and then the intercept at the line such that that particular choic of paramet maxim the likelihood So I want to maxim this product So we want to maxim the product of the likelihood of the error So that will actual be the same a minim over the product So if we want to minim this product of the likelihood of the error so over the product So let work on that a littl bit Let actual start by take the log It turn out that whatev paramet will minim the over the product
