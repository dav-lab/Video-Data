the path that minim that sum Structur of the algorithm other than that chang is basic the same For breadth first search in fact the first found solut may not be the best Becaus it minim by the structur of the algorithm the number of step the number of edg And so one need more sophist method to actual tri and solv it Just to give you a differ or a sens of the differ between them let look at a coupl of simpl littl exampl Here that graph abstract we had at the begin of our lectur about differ flight If we just minim the number of edg for exampl go from here to there either algorithm will find it
