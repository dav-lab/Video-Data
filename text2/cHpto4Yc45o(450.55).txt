Note that delta could be negat So this is say that we alway move in one or anoth direct We can get x We can get y And here we use the good old Pythagorean theorem a we just seen to find the distanc And final we have a way to print the locat So review the notabl aspect of Locat are two dimens no x and no y no built in assumpt about direct That becaus our delta x and delta y are float All right move on let look at our next interest type That go to be Field Field like Locat are also quit simpl
