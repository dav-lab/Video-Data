And so the i th element of t is if item i ha been taken by the burglar In other word it in the knapsack And it otherwis And so what we the problem we tri to do is to maxim the sum over all the item of t i v i So let see how that work So if the item ha not been taken t i is and that particular index doe contribut to the sum If the item ha been taken then t i is and that mean the valu is ad to the total valu of the knapsack So we want to find an assign of s and s for the vector t i such that we maxim the valu subject to the constraint
