statement that is index on the integ that is it a statement where one of the paramet is an integ if we want to show that that statement is true for all valu of n here how mathemat induct work We first go to prove that it true for n smallest valu which will typic be when n or n And then we go to prove that if that statement is true for an arbitrari valu of n you can show that it must be true when n is bigger If we can prove these thing we can prove it correct for small valu and we can prove that given ani valu it true for the next larger valu
