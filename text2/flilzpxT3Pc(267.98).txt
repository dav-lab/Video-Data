sub multipli what By the probabl that an individu molecul ha surviv And that is the probabl we just look at Let look at some code that implement this to comput how mani molecul are like to be in the bodi at ani point in time The function clear ha three argument n the initi number of molecul the probabl of a molecul be clear at each step and the number of step We start by initi numRemain to n so at time t equal there are n molecul Then for each step we append to numRemain the valu of the formula we just look at And then when we done we just plot it all
