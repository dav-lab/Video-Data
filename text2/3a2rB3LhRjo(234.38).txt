So in this case I just go to print out all the valu that get return by the generat that wa return from my call to genTest And you can see the for loop work great This is sort of fun Let imagin a slight more complic generat Here a generat that will produc success for each call to next all the number in the Fibonacci sequenc So if we go to go off and do that so here I go to say my Fibonacci generat is like so And inde fib is anoth generat So I can say fib next Well I got the first valu back So let see how the Fibonacci generat is work
