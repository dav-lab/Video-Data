stack and push these onto the front of the stack So they alway the first thing we go to look at a we carri on Let captur this then in an actual algorithm and this is pretti straightforward to do We gotten most of the piec we want We go to have some start node we go to have some goal node that we tri to get to and depth first search is go to take in a graph a start node and an end node and it go to take in anoth argument which may initi just be the empti list which is the path that is the sequenc of node that I current explor What the first thing I do Given a path that might be empti I go to extend it to a new path that includ that node the start node
