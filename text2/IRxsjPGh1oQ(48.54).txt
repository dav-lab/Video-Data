approxim due to Sir Isaac Newton often call the Newton Raphson algorithm becaus it wa found at the same time by Newton and by Raphson Here the basic idea behind it We want to find the root of a polynomi I remind you a polynomi p x is some sequenc of coeffici and power so it a n x to the n th power a n x to the n minus first power and so on It just a sequenc of number time power of x and what we often want to do is find a valu r such that p r is equal to We want to find the root the place where on that x axi that graph cross
