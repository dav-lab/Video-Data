I got the divis which is and the assign which is So there are step within the loop But it doe depend on the size of i It alway the same thing step within the loop So realli what matter is how mani time do I go through the loop And for that I have to think about so what is chang And what chang is the iter variabl or the loop variabl i And at each stage through the loop it get divid by So how mani time can I divid i by befor I get down to a singl digit case And the answer is a logarithm time so this is O log n Now let be care here you might say well wait a minut
