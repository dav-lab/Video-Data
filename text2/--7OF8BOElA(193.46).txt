possibl we alway want to look for a more effici solut And we go to see that we go to regular see quadrat problem so this is an issu If we can find a log linear one we like that solut And then the final comparison kind of is mind blow Exponenti algorithm are incred expens In fact here a plot over here of an exponenti versus a quadrat one and you ca even see the graph becaus the exponenti one is tuck right along this graph here blown up realli fast So if I replot this on a log scale which make the exponenti one now linear you can see how much better
