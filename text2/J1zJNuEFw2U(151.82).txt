Suppos our polynomi is just some coeffici c time x k then it first deriv is just cx And in particular if the polynomi is just someth simpl like x k then the deriv is just x Whi is that nice Well Newton Raphson say that given a guess g for the root a better guess is just shown right here is g g k all divid by g And rememb we were use this form to find squar root becaus it say if k is the valu of the squar root I want to find then that the polynomi I want to use So this littl formula say here a better way of find a guess for the squar root of k
