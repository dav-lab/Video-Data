I might want to find the shortest weight path Same thing but instead of choos the least number of edg I choos someth that minim the sum of the weight along the path And a we see later on we go to look at problem like cliqu and min cut Find a set of note for which there a path or often a path with the maximum length between everi pair in the set And given two set of node in a graph a cut is a set of edg whose remov will elimin all the path from everi node in one set to each node in the other set And the minimum cut is the smallest set of edg that accomplish that These we come back to later These we go to look at now
