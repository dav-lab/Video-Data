factori I simpli take that valu and multipli it by n And that give me that reduct exact like I saw befor Fantast There a recurs definit factori Let captur it in some code And in fact to do it let do both an iter version and a recurs version So the iter version of factori ha the form we expect I need some state variabl One of them is go to be just the paramet n that I pass in And the other one I go to call result I need to keep track of the comput a I go along I go to set a result initi to becaus I go to do success
