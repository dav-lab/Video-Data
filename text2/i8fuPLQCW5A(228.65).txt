And then if that item pass that test if that particular combin result in a weight that will fit in the knapsack then we can go off and comput the total valu of that particular trial knapsack and rememb the best one that we see a we go through all possibl combin of object So the onli hard part of write the code is to figur out how to generat all possibl combin of N item Here one way of do it and it is inspir by the count argument from the previous slide What we go to do and it happen here on this line is that we go to think of the vector t the N element vector t a a binari number
