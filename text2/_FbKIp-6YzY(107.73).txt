sub problem Now if it the case that I be abl to take the answer to these two sub problem and combin them some way I may be abl to come up with the answer for the origin problem And if that true if our comput exhibit this behavior we say that it ha optim substructur Another properti is that in do this sort of decomposit of the optim problem into sub problem we may discov that the same sub problem keep reoccur And when that happen so for exampl we may discov that we keep comput this particular function mani time And when that happen when we say that the sub problem are overlap In other word if we find ourselv comput the answer for the same
