If I not clever about the hash function I could have everyth go to one space in the hash tabl In which case I have the entir set of thing there in the list and I lost becaus I still have linear search So what it come down to is and this is sometim hard to do we like to have a realli good hash function And a realli good hash function ha a uniform distribut it minim the probabl of a collis With that idea that I go to hash by comput some function on the key that go to tell me where on the list to go to And I got to make the list larg enough that I can store most of the element in there but not too larg One of the question is just sort of intuit how good is hash
