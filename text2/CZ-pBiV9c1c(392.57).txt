And you might wonder whi we bother with the standard deviat And the answer is we not onli want an estim of pi we want to know how good the estim realli is And that what the next function doe for u The function estPi call getEst with an ever grow number of needl until getEst return an estim back with a confid interv that with a confid of is within precis of the actual valu It doe this by call throwNeedl with an ever larger number of needl until the standard deviat of the result of numTrial is no larger than precis divid by Under the valid assumpt that the error are normal distribut ie that random random realli is random this ensur that of the valu lie within precis of the mean
