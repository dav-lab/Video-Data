And when I say will work how do we know both that it actual go to stop and how do we know that it comput the valu that we want it to So I like to walk you through that a littl bit just to give you a sens of how we can reason about it Let start with the iter version iterMul we know termin becaus b start out initi posit and each time through the loop it decreas by And just by simpl logic if it start out a a posit or non zero non negat valu a an integ and we keep decreas by one at some point it go to get down to which wa our test case and it go to stop
