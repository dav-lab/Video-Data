And we saw that on the previous slide that small error are much more like than larg error And what we like to do is to now say OK well I have mani such observ that I made And the likelihood of make all those observ will be like with probabl the product of all the individu likelihood So if I go to go off and look at the likelihood of each observ what I go to do is to then multipli all those togeth And here what my job is go to be I want to choos the paramet of my predict So in this case it would be the constant over k That the slope of the line I want to choos the slope and then the intercept at the line such that
