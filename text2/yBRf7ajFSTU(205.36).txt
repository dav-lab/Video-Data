go to ask it to predict the extens creat by appli heavier weight We did make these measur but we sort of expect the spring to keep stretch a we appli higher and higher weight to it So everyth is just the same We are still do a linear fit here and a cubic fit here Let see what happen when we run this and plot the result So we tri to use our model here to determin the predict power of Terman law which hypothes a cubic relationship between the extens and the forc appli So we go to save this out and then run it OK here the result Oop
