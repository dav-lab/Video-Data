And if we do that if we do the invers of the weight that what we get And final a metric that us the ratio of the item valu to the item weight Final we have our usual test function We have testGreedi whose job it is simpli to run the greedi algorithm onc use the specifi metric and to print out the total number of item and their valu in the knapsack that get built use that particular metric And then final testGreedi allow u to test all three of the metric So let save that out and then give it to run and see what we get And here we go There the item we want to choos from right at the top
