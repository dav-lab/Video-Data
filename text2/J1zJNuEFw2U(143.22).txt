p g is a much better approxim OK so what doe this have to do with thing Well let look at an exampl a realli simpl case Suppos our polynomi is just some coeffici c time x k then it first deriv is just cx And in particular if the polynomi is just someth simpl like x k then the deriv is just x Whi is that nice Well Newton Raphson say that given a guess g for the root a better guess is just shown right here is g g k all divid by g And rememb we were use this form to find squar root becaus it say if k is the valu of the squar root I
