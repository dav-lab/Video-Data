So this basic say find the smallest valu in the right of i or to the right of i I should realli say And when I done that I go ahead and run through that entir loop then down here I just do a switch I have to be care I go to temporarili hold onto the valu at the ith locat of the list use temp right there So that I can take the thing at the minimum locat put it into i and then take a temporari thing and put it there So this is a standard way of do a switch I temporarili hold onto someth so I move into that locat and then the temporari thing and put it into that spot So you can see this is do what call select search I find the smallest thing I move it to the front I find the next smallest
