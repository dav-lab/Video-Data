We also be look into way of measur how well our curv is actual fit the data Up to now we been sort of eyebal it which wa a good start but we can actual develop some sensibl mathemat measur that will tell u about the good of the fit Here some Python code that let u experi with the data we got from fire the arrow with the bow As befor we have a procedur that help u get the data out of the data file and put it into a bunch of list In this case what we have is a bunch of distanc at which we made the differ measur and then for each distanc we have the height at that distanc from four separ experi To actual do the curv fit here we have tryFit which is veri much
