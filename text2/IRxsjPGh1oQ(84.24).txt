that graph cross Now that sound like a lot of math Let make it a littl simpler A simpl way to think about this is if we want to defin for exampl the squar root of we just need to find the root of the polynomi x Make sens if we combin the valu of x such that x is equal to we done becaus that the thing we want Now what Newton show wa that for thing like polynomi if g is an approxim to the root the place where it equal to then g p g p g is a better approxim where p is just the deriv of p
