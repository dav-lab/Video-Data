set of known solut Somebodi come up with a great algorithm how do I take a new problem and reduc it to someth that can take advantag of that algorithm And so that in fact often what we want to do is we want to understand what the inher complex of a problem And then think about how to break a problem down into sub problem which we can then relat to other problem for which there alreadi exist effici algorithm If we can reli on a great algorithm from somebodi els we go to use it So we go to look at an exampl of that and we go to look at it in the categori of deal with search algorithm So what a search algorithm
