And second we want to structur the problem in such a way that there a good possibl of overlap subproblem a we do our search Compar how we choos to structur the subproblem for the layout problem versus how we did it for the knapsack problem I think you find there a lot of similar Our goal in this problem is to find the optim layout of word in a paragraph so a to make the result look the most pleas This over here is simpli the oper of a greedi algorithm where we take the word a they come along and we keep ad them to the line until we run out of space and the next word would caus u to go beyond the margin so what we have to do is to start a new line So this is the result of a simpl greedi layout algorithm Peopl do like this becaus of the larg indent here
