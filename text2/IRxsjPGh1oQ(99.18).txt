the root of the polynomi x Make sens if we combin the valu of x such that x is equal to we done becaus that the thing we want Now what Newton show wa that for thing like polynomi if g is an approxim to the root the place where it equal to then g p g p g is a better approxim where p is just the deriv of p And if you have done calculus do worri about it We show you in a second what that mean but this is a power tool Newton prove this that given an approxim g p g
