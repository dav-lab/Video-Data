compos of decim digit I want to add up the charact of the string to get a number out A trivial littl thing to do but let look at what the code might look like I go to start off with some initi intern variabl call val And for each charact in the string I go to convert it into an integ and add it into what I got in val in order to return that overal valu I do care about the comput what I care about is the complex and the complex is pretti straightforward I have to go through each element in the string onc So this is linear in the length of the string Within the loop it a constant number of thing to do
