exponenti part So it E and it x minus x minus the mean squar all over sigma squar you can see what that mean that is the argument x get bigger the probabl associ with that becom exponenti smaller There some special name we appli If mu is equal to and the varianc is equal to we call that the unit normal or mayb the standard normal distribut So let put it all of it togeth So when our observ error are due to the accumul of mani small random process perturb the measur ever so slight we can say someth about the likelihood that the error will be of a certain size And we just use our inform about the error be normal
