to the variabl of the origin data So we can use the same sort of measur of variabl the varianc of the data which is again some sort of normal factor and we go to talk about the valu of the observ relat to the mean observ So that would be the varianc of the data And what we want to do is to compar those make a ratio of those two quantiti to get a sens of how well the model is fit the data So the fraction of the variabl that not explain by the model ha to do with the ratio of the variabl of the error which is the part that we not explain with the predict that we make over the variabl of the observ
