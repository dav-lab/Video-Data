Let just pick the midpoint between and x and tri it Now if we lucki the answer is close enough and then we done That unlik But even if that is not the case we have a good situat Even if we not close enough we can now ask wa that guess g too big or too small Well if g is bigger than x then we know that it too big We know that the squar root ha to lie somewher between and g And that say we can now instant just focus on this portion Do that we can again take the midpoint of that Let call it anoth version of g A new g And again we can say is that close enough
