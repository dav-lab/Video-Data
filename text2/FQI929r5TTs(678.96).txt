What kind of problem are they well suit for And what kind of output do they get For each one of those algorithm you ought to understand the relationship or the abstract on which they are built And of cours within each of these algorithm you also seen veri specif version of thing Binari search merg sort breadth first and depth first search are exampl of specif algorithm that come from differ class of algorithm And you know the kind of problem for which they well suit So you now alreadi have a map between problem and algorithm One of the other thing we saw is not onli do you have specif algorithm but a big element that we seen are optim problem
