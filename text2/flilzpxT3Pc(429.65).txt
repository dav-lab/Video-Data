by initi numRemain in the same way and iter through each step For each step it look at each molecul m and either clear it or not depend upon whether random random return a valu le than or equal to the clear probabl Then when it done it plot it The code down here first run clear and then clearSim so we now see in a singl plot the result of both way of comput the exponenti decay Notic that these two approach give u almost ident curv That a good thing I would have been worri if they had I also would have been worri by the way if they been ident sinc for one the simul there is some random
