And so we need to have a way of guid ourselv a we think about how to both test our code and then fix it So we go to talk about test method which are basic way of tri code on exampl to tri and figur out if it run correct And then onc we in fact isol that there may be a problem we go to talk about debug method which are way of fix the program that you know doe not work a you intend it to We go to talk about both of those throughout this lectur Now let start by think more abstract about sort of when should we in fact do these task When should you test and when should you debug Part of the goal here is it would be realli good if we could actual ahead of time figur out how to design our code to make it easier to do this
