optim problem into sub problem we may discov that the same sub problem keep reoccur And when that happen so for exampl we may discov that we keep comput this particular function mani time And when that happen when we say that the sub problem are overlap In other word if we find ourselv comput the answer for the same sub problem again and again and again Although if not an optim problem this definit for Fibonacci and it execut display the properti that we talk about on the previous slide We can see that to comput fib n we end up comput fib n and fib n of and this is the sort of substructur we were talk about And then of cours the comput involv ad
