We drop a few thing on you along the way But for the most part the rest of the lectur will be devot larg to how we go about build comput model that let u solv problem We start with simul model For most of the histori of scienc theorist use mathemat techniqu to construct truli analyt model that could be use to predict the behavior of a system from a set of paramet and initi condit This led to the develop of import mathemat tool rang from calculus to probabl theori and to a reason accur understand of the macroscop world but a those of u who look at physic know not realli of what go on say at the level of quantum mechan As the th centuri progress the limit of this approach becam
