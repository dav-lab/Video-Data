techs "], ["390.68", "but again  if i go back to univs  there it is "], ["392.73", "and now what happened to univs1 "], ["395.56", "aha!"], ["396.8", "it didn't change "], ["398.28", "and that's an

"], ["450.28", "it's just a pointer to that list "], ["453.61", "and the value of the second argument  or the second element  is just the"], ["457.91", "value of ivys "], ["458.82", "so aha  it's just pointing to there "], ["462.25", "so univs is a list whose elements are just pointers to other lists "], ["467.37", "on the other hand  what did i do when i created univs1 "], ["470.66", "if you look back  you'll see that  in fact  i created it by"], ["473.14", "actually typing out lists "], ["475.99", "i said univs1 "], ["477.03", "just to say a little bit of it "], ["478.29", "i said univs1 was going to be  and then i said quote mit "], ["482.41", "quote cal tech  comma "], ["483.91", "and then i did a bunch of other things "], ["485.31", "i'm not going to do all of it "], ["486.9", "but this is telling python  create a list with those strings inside of it "], ["492.47", "so in fact  that's exactly what it did "], ["495.912", "univs1 is going to create a list  but it creates it with a

went over here and changed that "], ["519.12", "it added that into the end of it "], ["521.33", "that means that univs changes because it sees that "], ["525.81", "but what about univs1 "], ["527.65",

which ivys and techs"], ["538.83", "are bound  but are the lists themselves "], ["541.46", "i got the value of techs  which pointed to the list "], ["545.16", "and this effect is something we call aliasing "], ["548.47", "basically what does aliasing says "], ["549.92", "it says we have two distinct paths to a data object "], ["553.94", "one is through the variable techs  in this case "],

important "], ["575.36", "and that mutation  that ability to change things  is really important "], ["578.84", "this is very convenient  but it also can be really dangerous "], ["582.52", "it can be treacherous "], ["583.81", "because if i had something that was changing techs and i didn't realize"], ["587.34", "that univs inherited the techs structure  i've now changed something"], ["591.55",

we do "], ["610.24", "well  we can certainly change elements directly "], ["612.8", "so if i go back  for example  and i look at techs "], ["616.39", "here's my list of tech schools  mit  cal tech

["783.76", "so quickly  to summarize "], ["785.27", "we have our electrocardiographic strip "], ["788.37", "we take two beats  we line them up  we perform dynamic time warping akin to a"], ["794.67", "sequence alignment  what is done in computational biology "], ["797.26", "and we get a number "], ["798.94", "we look at the next pair "], ["800.06", "we do the same sort of comparison "], ["802.03", "we line them up and we get another number "], ["804.15", "similarly  we do this for the next sequence of beats "], ["806.14", "we get another number "], ["806.79", "and we get this morphologic

in this signal means that there's lots of"], ["822.98", "changes in the heartbeat over time "], ["824.61", "even though these changes might be subtle  they'll be captured  because"], ["827.44", "computers are very good at computing these differences"], ["829.67", "and doing the alignment "], ["831.3", "and so then from that  we can use this time series to compute measures of the"],

this is given a name  r squared  and this is called the coefficient of"], ["516.19", "determination "], ["517.19", "so when the coefficient of determination is close to 1  that"], ["522.1", "means

that ratio of the variance of the errors over the"], ["595.38", "variance of the data  and then we subtract that from 1 to get the r"], ["599.47", "squared value "], ["600.87", "and then down here
