If the item ha been taken then t i is and that mean the valu is ad to the total valu of the knapsack So we want to find an assign of s and s for the vector t i such that we maxim the valu subject to the constraint And now we have to put in the weight constraint So that mean that the total weight of the item in the backpack So again we sum over all the item of t i w i is le than the maximum weight the backpack can hold So the techniqu now of find that maximum is we enumer all possibl combin of item So let think about what the vector of t look like for a particular combin What we have is a vector and it ha N element in it
