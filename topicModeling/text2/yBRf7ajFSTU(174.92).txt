Well how do we figur this out I mean here we fit some data and we sort of say gosh it certain look like that a better fit Well one of way we can evalu the power of a model is it predict power So what I want to do I go to start by let comment this guy back out again and look at that fitData which is just like fitData except what I done is that when I go to use the model for predict I go to ask it to predict the extens creat by appli heavier weight We did make these measur but we sort of expect the spring to keep stretch a we appli higher and higher weight to it So everyth is just the same
