Should we just go ahead and use the exhaust search to find the optim solut all the time To get some insight into how to best answer the burglar let look at the comput cost of each of the algorithm We can figur out the expect run time of the greedi algorithm a follow Rememb the first step wa to sort the item in order of their metric so in metric order If we rememb how long it take to sort a list of N item from a previous lectur we know that sort the number of oper involv is O N log N So that log base where N is the number of item in the list that we tri to sort
