But in general I just do have the time to run an all possibl test There are some formal method that is mathemat base method that can sometim help actual prove that the code is bug free But they usual onli work on simpl kind of code and they not go to be alway avail to u So let think about how do we do the test Well what we want to do is to find a collect of input that have a high likelihood of reveal bug but where the test is actual go to be pretti effici It not go to take a lot of time And this is call a test suit The idea is that we go to partit or divid up the space of input into subset that provid equival inform about the
