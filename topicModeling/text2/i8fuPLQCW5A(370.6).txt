Becaus we not realli interest in have the whole list in our hand at onc We basic go to be iter through the list check each possibl combin to see if it ha a legal weight and if so whether it valu is greater than the valu that we seen Here the Python code that implement the exhaust search that will find the best combin of item for the burglar to choos Here the power set function that we describ on the previous slide that generat a list show all the possibl combin of N item This is the actual exhaust search function It start off by initi this littl memori about the best knapsack seen to date So the best valu current is and we do have a best knapsack yet
