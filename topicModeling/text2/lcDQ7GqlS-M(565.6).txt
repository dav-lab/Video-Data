error at all and we expect most of our experiment observ to have some small amount of error Let put this observ into some code Up here we written a procedur that will comput the r squar valu given a set of measur and a set of predict valu And so here we can see that we calcul the sum of the squar of the estim error and then down here we first comput the mean of the observ valu and then we comput the differ between the mean and the measur valu and the sum of that squar So we left out the normal factor for the varianc sinc the two normal factor cancel on the ratio So final we form that ratio of the varianc of the error over the varianc of the data and then we subtract that from to get the r
