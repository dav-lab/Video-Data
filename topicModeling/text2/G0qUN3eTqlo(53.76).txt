so far which eventu we find there Have found that we swap those two element move on to the next point in the list move our marker up one and again scan for the smallest element in the list Which happen to be here so when we get to the end we swap those two And you get the idea We move the marker along the thing that we go to check along and we keep scan until we find the smallest element of the list which is right there Once we gotten to the end of the list know this is the smallest one we swap these two and we can carri on I not go to do the rest but you can see how we select find the next smallest element and put it at the front of the list
