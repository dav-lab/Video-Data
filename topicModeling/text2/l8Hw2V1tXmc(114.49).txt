I do know the detail of it It a squar root And it say sqrt take in two valu x and epsilon And it assum they both float that x is greater than or equal to epsilon is greater than and it go to return a result with a particular condit on the end OK what are the path through the specif Well if I look at this spec I can see that x there are two condit basic I can separ out when x is equal to from where x is greater than And I could in principl just creat two test case one for each one of those But I kind of know that not enough
