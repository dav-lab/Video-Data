And that is allow you then to map problem into templat you alreadi start to build up exampl of that bisect search depth first or breadth first search a exampl of common pattern that map into differ class of algorithm Some of them like bisect search are nice and effici Other some graph search method are much more complex but that also wa becaus sometim the problem are just inher expens to solv And when we get a problem that we realiz is inher expens to solv that lead natur to the idea of one of the other big topic which wa the notion of tri to find approxim But onc we start realiz algorithm come in differ class and there are standard templat for them it allow u to start think about how to begin to map problem into particular solut
