describ the PDF the Probabl Densiti Function for a normal distribut So that f x and we have a normal constant which is over the squar root of pi sigma squar and then we get the exponenti part So it E and it x minus x minus the mean squar all over sigma squar you can see what that mean that is the argument x get bigger the probabl associ with that becom exponenti smaller There some special name we appli If mu is equal to and the varianc is equal to we call that the unit normal or mayb the standard normal distribut So let put it all of it togeth So when our observ error are due to the accumul of mani small
