And we go to do it for such experi Let write a littl program and see what the result look like Here a Python procedur testError that will let u run our littl experi What testError doe is for the number of trial that we ask for in this case the default valu for trial is it will go off and select a certain number of point in this case from a particular probabl distribut in this case a triangular distribut that go between and So that exact the distribut that we graph on the slide It will then sum up the result of each of those random select and then it will keep a list of all the sum that it creat for all trial that we do
