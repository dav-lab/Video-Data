It look a littl bit daunt but it realli not a bad a you think What doe it say It say I go to have some valu of x I go to start with OK I go to pick an epsilon which is go to tell me how close I am and I go to keep track of how mani guess I did a well I go to set up initi a low and high valu which are to start with and the valu of x That my rang where which I want to be tri to do the comput My answer is initi go to be the midpoint halfway between low and high And then what do I do I run through one of these littl loop where again I basic say am I close enough If this is true then I too far apart
