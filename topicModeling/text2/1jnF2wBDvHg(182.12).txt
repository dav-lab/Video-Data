And I extend that path by one step go to each of the possibl child of the current node So I take the current path Then I replac it in my set with this set of new path that each go one step further So I add these path to the set of path at the front of the set I then take that first path at front of the set and I do the same thing and recurs repeat that And I go to keep do that until hope I get to the goal node If I get to the node in a path which ha no child then I just go on to the next path And I keep do that until I either reach the goal or I run out of path
