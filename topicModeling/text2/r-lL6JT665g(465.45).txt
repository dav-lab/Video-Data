When we look at decim digit we saw that it wa n And now with the dice we look at digit base So the number of possibl are go to be n So for a six side die there are possibl sequenc of length five That tell u is the probabl of roll consecut one should be over a pretti small number It approxim equal to or a simpler way to think about it out of possibl Pretti low but no lower than the probabl of ani other particular sequenc of five roll Let look at a simul to check this So I go to use rollN which us rollDi to do the simul getTarget take a goal which is a string for exampl five one
