In fact the more flip we do the larger we can expect the absolut differ to get What converg is the ratio Now let look at a small function that illustr the law of larg number at work The function flipPlot take two argument The minimum expon and the maximum expon It initi some thing to the empti list It then build the x axi for what we go to plot that is to say the number of flip we go to experi with And it look at all flip in rang from to the minimum expon to to the maximum expon So it will tri
