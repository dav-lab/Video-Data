and the predict we describ a the error So the likelihood that the predict is the right one is sort of determin by the size of the error So we take the i th observ and we comput the error by subtract off the i th predict And so this is the likelihood here of such an error occur And the likelihood get bigger the smaller the error is And we saw that on the previous slide that small error are much more like than larg error And what we like to do is to now say OK well I have mani such observ that I made And the likelihood of make all those observ will be like with probabl the product of all the individu likelihood
