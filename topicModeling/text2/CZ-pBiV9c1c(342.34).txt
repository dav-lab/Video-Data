It then us the Pythagorean theorem here to comput the hypotenus of the right triangl with base x and y This is the distanc from the tip of the needl from the origin Sinc we know that the radius of a circl is we know that the needl lie within the circl if and onli if the distanc from the origin is no greater than We then use this fact to count the number of needl in the circl The function getEst us throwNeedl to find an estim of pi by drop numNeedl needl and averag the result over numTrial It also comput the standard deviat print what it do and then return both the current estim and the standard deviat And you might wonder whi we bother with the standard deviat And the answer is we not onli want an estim of pi we want to know how
