An exponenti algorithm is one where the number of basic step asymptot is describ by some constant to n the size of the problem So that could be n And keep in mind that n grow in a veri differ manner than n a we chang n And in fact this sequenc is realli list in rough the order of increas complex Each one of these class describ a slight more complex kind of algorithm And a a consequ we tend to want to be a high up in this chain a we can If I have two algorithm that solv the same problem one of them is
