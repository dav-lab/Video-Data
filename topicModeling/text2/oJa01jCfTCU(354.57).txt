and then count backward to minus and then to minus So that minus index will return a the c So it basic start at the back end and count backward So we get out compon of string which is good Now sometim we want to get out not just a singl element we want to get out a substr of a string And for that we have a techniqu call slice So we have a string call s then this express here where we have two express a start and an end that are both integ or their valu are integ that denot the substr that start at the index point to by start and stop just befor the index point to by end So just to see that
