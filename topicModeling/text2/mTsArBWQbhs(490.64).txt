What the shortest path Given two node in the graph find the shortest sequenc of edg that go from the sourc to a node to a node to a node to the destin And the properti are that the sourc node is the first edg of the first edg rather is that initi one N The destin node of the last edg is N and for everi sequenc in that the shortest path the sourc node of EB is the destin node of EA It just say I can link them togeth I might want to find the shortest weight path Same thing but instead of choos the least number of edg I choos someth that minim the sum of the weight along the path And a we see later on we go to look at problem like cliqu and min cut
