If I got an algorithm that is log linear n log n and anoth one that is just logarithm I want the log one becaus it alway go to be better Final we tend to be a littl sloppi in this subject in term of how we use these term Realli what we talk about here are upper bound on the complex of the algorithm on the number of step In mani case it an actual tight bound it both an upper and lower bound But if we not certain about an algorithm we may end up say for exampl that it exponenti becaus the best analysi we can do say that the run time may involv an exponenti number of step It may be possibl to show that it le than that but if we ca
