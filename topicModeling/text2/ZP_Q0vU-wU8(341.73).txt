That work when I know that the size of each element is a particular size I can alloc a specif amount of memori for each one But what if the list of object are thing that have arbitrari size Now what do I do And in this case I use a wonder tool call indirect Here insid of Python I go to repres the list a two thing A length tell me how mani object there are in the list so I know where the end of the list is and then a sequenc of fix size pointer to object Or anoth way of say it is insid of the list each element of the list is go to be the element itself It go to be a pointer to an object A pointer to a structur in memori
