So how do we break an initi problem into subproblem It go a follow What we do is we consid take the first word from the list and basic say look there no line break after this word So what we go to do is to lay out the rest of the list but we go to start after the first word So the remain word will start on the same line a the current word except the start column will be move over by the width of the first word Plus a that correspond to the space between the first word and the rest of the word So the subproblem is pleas lay out all the rest of the word list but leav room in the current line for the current word
