case can make a realli big differ and I want to give you a sens of that So just to do that let take a look What the differ between a constant logarithm and a logarithm one So what I graph here is the amount of time it take for an algorithm and this is constant that ha step versus a logarithm algorithm that ha onli step within it loop And notic it take an argument of size almost befor the logarithm algorithm actual catch up to the constant one Of cours if the log algorithm had step it
