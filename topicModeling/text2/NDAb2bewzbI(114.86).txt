And all togeth well let see if we do order of calcul that mean that when we add two order of we just simpli pick the larger of the two a our overal estim the term that will domin a N get larg So what we see is that the run time of the greedi algorithm is domin by the short time which is O N log base N What about the run time for the exhaust search which let u find the optim solut Well the first step in there we need to enumer all the possibl combin of item And that ha cost order O N becaus there N possibl combin
