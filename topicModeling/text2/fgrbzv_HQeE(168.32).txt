All right with that in mind whi are we do graph optim Well a we said we have lot of problem that are natur express a a set of transit between a state of a system And those often can be easili solv a a graph search Simpl exampl would be one where the actual structur the problem is itself a graph Travel through a physic network whether it a flight network or whether it actual someth like use your GPS to find drive rout from one locat to anoth In those case the node natur correspond to physic locat like hub or intersect And the edg natur correspond to physic structur flight path road
