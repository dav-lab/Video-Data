thing that somebodi els ha develop that are effici And we just seen a nice exampl of that becaus what we just seen is that if we combin the idea of binari search with the idea of a divid and conquer for do merg sort that that actual give u a veri effici search algorithm In this case in particular if we want to search a list k time then the effici is n log n in order to do the sort plus k log n in order to do the search k time And that rememb we compar against someth that is k n And so that say boy we like to be do much better And if n is of ani reason size then the n log n time k log n is like to be much smaller than just k n This still leaf the question of can we do better
