but we can actual develop some sensibl mathemat measur that will tell u about the good of the fit Here some Python code that let u experi with the data we got from fire the arrow with the bow As befor we have a procedur that help u get the data out of the data file and put it into a bunch of list In this case what we have is a bunch of distanc at which we made the differ measur and then for each distanc we have the height at that distanc from four separ experi To actual do the curv fit here we have tryFit which is veri much like the routin we written befor We convert the distanc which were in yard into foot and then we go to process the four measur from each of the
