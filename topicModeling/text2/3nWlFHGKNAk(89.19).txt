Let also assum that for ani pair of citi A and C if I want to fli from A to C through B that is A to B to C the cost of that flight A to C is the same a the cost from A to B and the cost from B to C If I have that what might I like to know Well I might like to know what the best set of flight that ha the fewest stop between two citi I might like to know what the least expens airfar between two citi Or even constrain thing like what the cheapest flight from A to C that doe go through more than one other stop along the way or no more than two other stop along the way All right so you can imagin I might like to do this What doe a graph have to do with this Well let think about how to captur this problem
