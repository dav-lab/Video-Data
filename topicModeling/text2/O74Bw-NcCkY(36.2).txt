So if we start off with a list of element like what shown here in the first stage we go to split it into two part And actual we would do this recurs first with the front part and then the back part But I go to show it in parallel And we keep split it until we get down to list of just two element each such a for exampl shown here where I got two one element list At this stage I can start merg by look at each element and put the smallest element first follow by the next element I then look at the next list and again these are two list of one element each So I can onc more look at each element to decid how to put the smallest element up first and then the next element
