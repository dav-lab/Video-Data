One of which is it onli work for posit integ But we could find cube root of negat number we just know that it go to be a negat version of whatev the cube root of that absolut valu would be So we could actual go back and fix this and we can do it pretti straightforward Let go back into our code and in particular now just add a coupl thing One is we go to look to see whether the thing we check for is le than the absolut valu of x And similar to check to see whether the thing cube is equal to the absolut valu of x That nice
