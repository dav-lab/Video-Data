logarithm one So what I graph here is the amount of time it take for an algorithm and this is constant that ha step versus a logarithm algorithm that ha onli step within it loop And notic it take an argument of size almost befor the logarithm algorithm actual catch up to the constant one Of cours if the log algorithm had step it would scale up beyond this But this is realli a way of say log algorithm grow incred slowli in complex and therefor they are realli power
