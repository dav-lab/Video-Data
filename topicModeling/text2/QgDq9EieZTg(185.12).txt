If we can prove these thing we can prove it correct for small valu and we can prove that given ani valu it true for the next larger valu Then induct say we can assum it is true for all valu of n That power becaus it a way of help u deduc that our code if we can use it there work all the time This may sound a littl funni so let look at a veri simpl exampl from math And here the simpl exampl If I add up all the integ from all the way up to n the claim is that that is equal to n n all divid by
